# ubuntu_environment
All the scripts that I need when running an ubuntu VM

Added an script to install docker-machine into ubuntu VM
   We have already included the necessary dependencies for installing docker-machine: 
	- Having CURL already installed. 
		If not, just uncomment the lines which contains the commands for the installation of CURL

	- Having Docker binary already installed.
		If not, just uncomment the lines which contains the commands for the installation of Docker Binary.
